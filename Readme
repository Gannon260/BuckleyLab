This is the code written for the a Multilayer Machine Learning Project.

The code is written in MATLAB and Python, The purpose is to fit a traditionally regression-based cost minimization algorithms 
with Artificial Neural Networks. The technique is still being validated relative to Monte Carlo simulations however the preliminary
results are promising.
