dark indicates that the phantoms were measured in a dark room.
the other data was measured while the room was light.
homogenous-fast is where both layers were a 'fast' phantom created from just 20% intralipid, india ink and water.
the -newfilter indicates that a new filter was placed over the first detector, to decrease intensity
the fiber was initially pulled out to decrease intensity.


detectors 3,4,5,6 were used to acquire data at 10, 15, 20, and 25 mm respectively.

two layer phantom box was constructed from black spray painted 3d printed box and the two layers
were created using a saran wrap separation.

the phantoms were approximately 75 degrees fahrenhiet (room temperature)

Top Layer (Slow Phantom, made 20190220): 650mL water (tap water), 350 mL glycerol, 100 mL 20% I.L. 0.57mL Ink

Bottom Layer (Fast Phantom, made 02190219): 1400 mL water, 57 mL I.L. 0.87 mL ink (used this recipe)

the separation from detector to two-layer film was about 1.0 cm
