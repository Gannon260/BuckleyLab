multipleSD holds matlab files relating to files that involve playing around with different Source Detector Seperaitons
Denoising holds (failed) attempts to reduce the overall noise of our input g2 curves to then fit into a neural net model to predict db2
pcaThenNonLinearregression holds files trying to solve for db2 using PCA and nonlinear regression.
Plotting holds generic plotting functions to evaluate neural networks.
playground holds miscellaneous files that were for testing purposes.
KerasImplementation holds Python files that try to solve for db2 given g2 curves with neural nets in Keras (Tensorflow)
figures holds all figures generated from each folder, helps keeps things tidy.
Experimental hold actual data and analysis code of that data.
